"iwana-protobuf" will only build on OS X.

When importing into eclipse, make sure you don't import "iwana-protobuf";
otherwise, you will get compilation errors. Instead, do a "mvn clean
install" and let Eclipse use the Maven-built jar.

Prerequisites:

protobuf 2.5.0
Install via "brew install protobuf250"

proto-dump 0.1
Obtain from https://github.com/obriensp/proto-dump
